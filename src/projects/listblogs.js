        "content" :"A few years ago I wasted my energy and sanity by spending hours in front of the screen with the Id in front of me. Now I realize that I was not studying or coding in the most efficient and healthy way. Since in 2021 he implemented a technique called Pomodoro in which it is recommended to work 20 minutes and rest 5 and every certain round he takes a long break Over time I adapted these times to my energy load depending on the day. I realized that the best way for my productivity is when I'm learning something new to implement 05/20 since when doing something heavier it allows me not to get stressed but when I'm creating with tools and knowledge that I already know or the difficulties are not so high I implement 50/10 as it allows me to get into the flow and stay inspired and focused. Implementing this has allowed me to take care of my mental health and stay more motivated in the face of difficulties."

        "content":"Hi, I am a web developer with one year of experience working in a company that offers its clients technological solutions and support for existing products. I started in the world of development in 2018, studying the technical career of computer programming at AIEP (Institute in Chile). I love development in general but being so new and seeing the result of my efforts on screen encouraged me to choose this path. At the beginning it was quite simple. However, since in web development I was able to see in a striking way the progressive advance of my knowledge, I was motivated. When starting on this path I never imagined how big web development is. I started studying HTML, CSS and JavaScript creating small projects with fairly simple interfaces. One of my greatest qualities is that I always internalize the knowledge I acquire, creating projects to improve with practice. Later I realized that when searching on YouTube they used libraries and frameworks that they did not know and created pages so well designed that they started to immerse me in things like Bootstrap. After 2 years I had to change my way of seeing things because I got to my hate React and had to learn a whole new framework. The truth is that I have learned a lot on this path and not only hard skills but also to know how I learn, to be self-taught, to always have a space in my day to day to learn and practice. I know that the path can be intimidating but do not give up, constant learning is inevitable but so is reaching your goal."
